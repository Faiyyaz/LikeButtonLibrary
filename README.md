# LikeButton

Thanks to ChadCSong

LikeButton has been created by using ShineButton relased by ChadCSong but it has a little change which i was required for my project i.e. suppose if you are calling an API for favorite or unfavorite & you want to start stop animation after response then it was not possible in ShineButton. But it had been made possible in LikeButton by using the `setcheked()` method of likebutton.
